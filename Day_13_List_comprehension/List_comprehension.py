# You can change a string of characters into a list in different ways.
# Example

my_name = "Alex Mwangi"

change_to_list = list(my_name) # Chnage the string my_name to list

print("My name is ", my_name)
print("The list is ", change_to_list)

# Another way to convert the list is

full_name = "Alex Mwangi"

the_list = [i for i in full_name]

print("The same list is ",the_list)
